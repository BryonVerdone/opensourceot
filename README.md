# Open Source OT

The goal with Open Source OT is to facilitate a free repository of occupational therapy activities created bt the OT community. While working as a COTA (Certified OT Assistant) I would regularly be asked for additional activities or exercises that my clients could perform on their own. So I decided to create my own resource for others to use.

The occupational therapy community is one built upon sharing ideas and techniques with other practitioners. My hope is that this will serve as a tool for OT's and the individuals they support. OT practitioners will be able to submit their own activities to the site by providing step by step instructions and visual aids.

# How to contribute

If you would like to contribute to the project take a look [here](https://github.com/users/BryonVerdone/projects/4) for current issues.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
